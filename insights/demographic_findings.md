# Demographic Findings from Aadhaar Data

This document summarizes the key demographic insights discovered through the Aadhaar demographic data pipeline.

## National Demographic Composition

- Children (5–17) form a small portion of the Aadhaar population (~10%)
- Adults (18+) dominate the demographic structure (~90%)

This indicates Aadhaar coverage is significantly higher among adults than children.

## State-Level Demographic Structure

The state demographic summary reveals large variation in child-to-adult ratios across states.

Some states have a relatively higher youth population, while others are strongly adult-dominant.

## Top Child-Dominant States

These states have the highest share of child population relative to adults:

- Ladakh
- Arunachal Pradesh
- Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu
- Chandigarh
- Karnataka
- Telangana
- Lakshadweep
- Puducherry
- Tamil Nadu
- Jammu and Kashmir

These regions may require stronger focus on:

- School infrastructure

- Youth development programs

## Top Adult-Dominant States

These states have the highest adult population share:

- Maharashtra
- West Bengal
- Punjab
- Jharkhand
- Sikkim
- Bihar
- Kerala
- Chhattisgarh
- Assam

These regions are more workforce-heavy and may require:

- Employment planning

- Economic opportunity expansion

## National Child Population Trend

The time-series analysis shows fluctuation in the national child population share over time, indicating changing demographic patterns.

This insight can be valuable for long-term policy planning.

## Conclusion

The Aadhaar dataset can be transformed into powerful demographic intelligence when processed through a structured data pipeline, enabling evidence-based regional planning and governance decisions.
